### allergy_intolerance

> [!NOTE]
>
> Risk of harmful or undesirable physiological response which is specific to an individual and associated with exposure to a substance. A record of a clinical assessment of an allergy or intolerance; a propensity, or a potential risk to an individual, to have an adverse reaction on future exposure to the specified substance, or class of substance.
>
> Where a propensity is identified, to record information or evidence about a reaction event that is characterised by any harmful or undesirable physiological response that is specific to the individual and triggered by exposure of an individual to the identified substance or class of substance.
>
> Substances include, but are not limited to: a therapeutic substance administered correctly at an appropriate dosage for the individual; food; material derived from plants or animals; or venom from insect stings.

### appointment

> [!NOTE]
> A booking of a healthcare event among patient(s), practitioner(s), related person(s) and/or device(s) for a specific date/time. This may result in one or more Encounter(s).
> Appointment resources are used to provide information about a planned meeting that may be in the future or past. The resource only describes a single meeting, a series of repeating visits would require multiple appointment resources to be created for each instance. Examples include a scheduled surgery, a follow-up for a clinical visit, a scheduled conference call between clinicians to discuss a case (where the patient is a subject, but not a participant), the reservation of a piece of diagnostic equipment for a particular use, etc. The visit scheduled by an appointment may be in person or remote (by phone, video conference, etc.) All that matters is that the time and usage of one or more individuals, locations and/or pieces of equipment is being fully or partially reserved for a designated period of time.
> This definition takes the concepts of appointments in a clinical setting and also extends them to be relevant in the community healthcare space, and to ease exposure to other appointment / calendar standards widely used outside of healthcare.

### encounter

> [!NOTE]
> An interaction between a patient and healthcare provider(s) for the purpose of providing healthcare service(s) or assessing the health status of a patient.
>
> A patient encounter is further characterized by the setting in which it takes place. Amongst them are ambulatory, emergency, home health, inpatient and virtual encounters. An Encounter encompasses the lifecycle from pre-admission, the actual encounter (for ambulatory encounters), and admission, stay and discharge (for inpatient encounters). During the encounter the patient may move from practitioner to practitioner and location to location.

## Ages

Ages shown in the OLIDS dataset for de-identified (also known as "masked" or "pseudonymised") data are shown in:

- whole integer years
- age brackets aligned to HES child ages
- days since birth up to 27 days for neonates

This is aligned with the Hospital Episode Statistics age categorisation as below:

| OLIDS Column | HES column | Definitions | Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `AGE_AT_EVENT` | `age` | **HES:** <br> Number of whole years between patient's date of birth and the event. <br>The event date typically used is the end date, unless otherwise stated within the column name. <br><br>**OLIDS:**<br> Number of whole years between patient's date of birth and the event. <br>The event date typically used is the end date, unless otherwise stated within the column name. | nnn = Age in years |
| `AGE_AT_EVENT_BABY` | `ENDAGE` and `STARTAGE` (APC) <br> `APPTAGE` (OP) <br> `ARRIVALAGE` (AE) | **HES:**<br>The patient's age, in completed years, at the end of a finished episode. <br>For patients under 1 year old, special codes in the range 7001 to 7007 apply.<br><br>**OLIDS:**<br>The patient's age, in completed years, at the end of an event. <br>For patients under 1 year old, special codes in the range 7001 to 7007 apply. | nnn = Age in years<br> 120 = 120 years or more<br> 7001 = Less than 1 day  <br> 7002 = 1 to 6 days  <br> 7003 = 7 to 28 days  <br> 7004 = 29 to 90 days (under 3 months)  <br> 7005 = 91 to 181 days (approximately 3 months to under 6  months)  <br> 7006 = 182 to 272 days (approximately 6 months to under 9 months)  <br> 7007 = 273 to <1 year (approximately 9 months to under 1 year)  <br> Null = Not applicable (other maternity event) or not known <br> [See HES Data Dictionary](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics/hospital-episode-statistics-data-dictionary)|
| `AGE_AT_EVENT_NEONATE` | `NEODUR` (APC) | **HES:** <br>The age in days of a baby admitted as a patient. It is derived from the Admission Date (ADMIDATE) and Date of Birth (DOB). <br>If the baby is older than 27 days, NEODUR is not calculated. <br><br>**OLIDS:** <br>The age of a patient at the end of an event where the patient is under 28 days old.<br> If the baby is older than 27 days, no age in days is given. | 2n = Age of patient in days from 0 to 27. <br> `NULL` = Not applicable. Patient is older than 27 days. |
